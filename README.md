### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
```

### **2. Backend Setup**
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:
   ```env
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   DB_NAME=library_db
   PORT=5000
   ```
   Replace `DB_URI` with your MongoDB connection string if using a cloud-hosted database.

4. Start the backend server:
